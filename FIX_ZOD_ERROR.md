# Fix: Zod Validation Error

## The Problem

```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_zod')
```

This error occurs because the dev server has cached modules and needs to be restarted.

## Solution

### Step 1: Stop the dev server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running.

### Step 2: Clear Next.js cache (optional but recommended)

```bash
Remove-Item -Path ".next" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Step 3: Restart the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test again

1. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Send a message to generate a workflow
3. Click "Insert to n8n"
4. Should work now!

## Alternative: Quick Restart

If the above doesn't work, try a hard refresh:

1. Stop the dev server
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Restart dev server
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Why This Happens

When we updated the dependencies during the refactoring, the Next.js dev server was still running with the old module cache. Zod was properly installed, but the running process had a stale reference to it.

Restarting the dev server loads the fresh modules and resolves the issue.

**TL;DR**: Stop and restart `npm run dev`
